                Driven by a desire to improve medication adherence, a passionate group of engineers are dedicated to building a smart medical reminder system. Our project aims to address the challenge of missed or incorrect medication doses, which can have serious health consequences. By combining technological expertise with an understanding of patients' needs, we envision a system that utilizes user-friendly interfaces, integrates with existing medication schedules, and provides timely reminders along with educational resources. Our ultimate goal is to empower individuals to manage their health effectively and contribute to a healthier future
